Ren Mingxuan graduated with an undergraduate degree in Journalism from Nanjing University(http://jc.nju.edu.cn). and is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Journalism at the same institution. She is a person who can be both wildly eccentric and profoundly serious. As a complete novice in computing, she is diligently learning to build her own website. Should you happen upon her webpage, do come and make friends with her â€“ she would be absolutely delighted. Thank you for reading this utterly pointless ramble. Cheers~
